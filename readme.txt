The file contains a .zip file with annotations for the test set of all the cameras covering the entire car. Additionally, two .py files used to perform distillation with YOLOv5 are available in the folder. Add these two files to the cloned YOLOv5 repository, which is accessible at this link: https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-train-yolov5-on-a-custom-dataset/

Note that the provided link will lead to a Colab Notebook for conducting the experiments. To train the student model, utilize the following command:

!python distil.py --img 640 --alpha 0 --freeze 10 --batch 16 --epochs 20 --data ./data.yaml --weights ./yolov5n.pt --cfg ./yolov5/models/yolov5n.yaml --teacher ./best.pt --name yolov5n_stu0


Ensure that you have cloned the YOLOv5 repository and added the necessary files before executing the above command.
